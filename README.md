# Fast and Robust Text Detection in Images and Video Frames

## Project Overview
This repository contains a computer vision project focused on text detection from static images and video streams. The project utilizes Python and computer vision libraries to detect and recognize text effectively.

## Repository Contents
- `text_detection.py`: Script for detecting text in static images.
- `text_detection_video.py`: Script for detecting text in video streams.
- `images/`: Directory containing sample images and video stills used for testing the text detection algorithms.
- `Documentation.pdf`: Detailed documentation and report on the project's development and outcomes.

## Features
- **Text Detection in Images:** Utilizes OpenCV and other libraries to detect text within various images.
- **Text Detection in Videos:** Extends the text detection capability to real-time video streams.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive guide and explanation of the methodologies used, available in `Documentation.pdf`.
